# SSDG

**IMPORTANT TIP FOR TRAINING ON LINUX: PYTORCH SHIPS WITH ITS OWN CUDA TOOLKIT NECESSARY BINARIES AND DEPENDANCIES, SO WHEN YOU INSTALL A CERTAIN VERSION, THE ONLY THING TO DO IS EMPTY THE LD_LIBRARY_PATH VARIABLE TEMPORARILY AND LET PYTORCH LOAD ITS OWN LIBS. IT DOES NOT USE YOUR LOCAL CUDA AND CUDNN INSTALLATION AND THOSE ARE ONLY NEEDED IF YOU WANT TO BUILD PYTORCH FROM SOURCE. THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE HAVE IN TENSORFLOW.**

## Congifuration Environment
- python 3.6 
- pytorch 0.4 
- torchvision 0.2
- cuda 8.0

## Pre-training

**Dataset.** 

Download the OULU-NPU, CASIA-FASD, Idiap Replay-Attack, and MSU-MFSD datasets.

**Data Pre-processing.** 

[MTCNN algotithm](https://github.com/YYuanAnyVision/mxnet_mtcnn_face_detection) is utilized for face detection and face alignment. All the detected faces are normlaize to 256$\times$256$\times$3, where only RGB channels are utilized for training. 

To be specific, we process every frame of each video and then utilize the `sample_frames` function in the `utils/utils.py` to sample frames during training.

Put the processed frames in the path `$root/data/dataset_name`.

**Data Label Generation.** 

Move to the `$root/data_label` and generate the data label list:
```python
python generate_label.py
```

## Training

Move to the folder `$root/experiment/testing_scenarios/` and just run like this:
```python
python train_ssdg_full.py
```

The file `config.py` contains all the hype-parameters used during training.

## Testing

Run like this:
```python
python dg_test.py
```
